<!-- How It Started -->
## How It Started

The first idea came with the problem that our wallets were becoming bigger and bigger each day. Every supermarket, food shop, cinema, pharmacy have they're own loyalty card. With this loyalty cards you have your own rewards such as collecting points, membership, discounts and etc. We all love rewards but it get's really frustrating to carry so many loyalty cards in your pocket. The idea was born from this issues! On the following screenshots you can see the first ideas in Figma.
